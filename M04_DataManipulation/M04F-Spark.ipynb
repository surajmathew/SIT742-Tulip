    "\n",
    "Many traditional frameworks were designed to be run on a single computer. However, many datasets today are too large to be stored on a single computer, and even when a dataset can be stored on one computer (such as the datasets in this tutorial), the dataset can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.  Spark has efficient implementations of a number of transformations and actions that can be composed together to perform data processing and analysis.  Spark excels at distributing these operations across a cluster while abstracting away many of the underlying implementation details. Spark has been designed with a focus on scalability and efficiency. With Spark you can begin developing your solution on your laptop, using a small dataset, and then use that same code to process terabytes or even petabytes across a distributed cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following transformations will be covered:\n",
    "*  `map()`, `mapPartitions()`, `mapPartitionsWithIndex()`, `filter()`, `flatMap()`, `sortByKey()`, `reduceByKey()`, `groupByKey()`, `Join()`, `leftOuterJoin()`, `rightOuterJoin()`, `fullOuterJoin()`\n",
    " \n",
    "The following actions will be covered:\n",
    "*  `first()`, `take()`, `takeSample()`, `takeOrdered()`, `collect()`, `count()`, `countByValue()`, `reduce()`, `fold()`, `aggregate()`, `top()` \n",
    " \n",
    "Also covered:\n",
    "*  `cache()`, `unpersist()`, `id()`, `setName()`\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that, for reference, you can look up the details of these methods in [Spark's Python API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD)\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you will test that the virtual machine (VM) is functioning properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not need to solve any problems to complete this lab.  You can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.

    "###  **1. Spark Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spark, communication occurs between a driver and executors.  The driver has Spark jobs that it needs to run and these jobs are split into tasks that are submitted to the executors for completion.  The results from these tasks are delivered back to the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "In section 1, we saw that normal python code can be executed via cells. When using Databricks Cloud this code gets executed in the Spark driver's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and not in an executor's JVM, and when using an IPython notebook it is executed within the kernel associated with the notebook. Since no Spark functionality is actually being used, no tasks are launched on the executors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Spark functionality and its API we will need to use a `SparkContext`.  When running Spark, you start a new Spark application by creating a [SparkContext](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.SparkContext.html).  When the `SparkContext` is created, it asks the master for some cores to use to do work.  The master sets these cores aside just for you; they won't be used for other applications. When using Databricks Cloud or the virtual machine provisioned for this class, the `SparkContext` is created for you automatically as `sc`.\n",

In all cases, this driver program contains the main loop for the program and creates distributed datasets on the cluster, then applies operations (transformations & actions) to those datasets.\n",

    "In Spark, datasets are represented as a list of entries, where the list is broken up into many different partitions that are each stored on a different machine.  Each partition holds a unique subset of the entries in the list.  Spark calls datasets that it stores \"Resilient Distributed Datasets\" (RDDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the defining features of Spark, compared to other data analytics frameworks (e.g., Hadoop), is that it stores data in memory rather than on disk.  This allows Spark applications to run much more quickly, because they are not slowed down by needing to read data from disk.\n",

    "![partitions](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/partitions.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the RDD, we use `sc.parallelize()`, which tells Spark to create a new set of input data based on data that is passed in.  In this example, we will provide an `range`.  The second argument to the [sc.parallelize()](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.SparkContext.parallelize.html) method tells Spark how many partitions to break the data into when it stores the data in memory (we'll talk more about this later in this tutorial). Note that for better performance when using `parallelize`, `range()` is recommended if the input represents a range. This is the reason why we used `range()` in 3a.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of RDDs.  The base class for RDDs is [pyspark.RDD](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.RDD.html) and other RDDs subclass `pyspark.RDD`.  Since the other RDD types inherit from `pyspark.RDD` they have the same APIs and are functionally identical.  We'll see that `sc.parallelize()` generates a `pyspark.rdd.PipelinedRDD` when its input is an `range`, and a `pyspark.RDD` when its input is a `range`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we generate RDDs, we can view them in the \"Storage\" tab of the web UI.  You'll notice that new datasets are not listed until Spark needs to return a result due to an action being executed.  This feature of Spark is called \"lazy evaluation\".  This allows Spark to avoid performing unnecessary calculations."

    "\n",
    "So far, we've created a distributed dataset that is split into many partitions, where each partition is stored on a single machine in our cluster.  Let's look at what happens when we do a basic operation on the dataset.  Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the dataset\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can parallelize the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "`map(f)`, the most common Spark transformation, is one such example: it applies a function `f` to each item in the dataset, and outputs the resulting dataset.  When you run `map()` on a dataset, a single *stage* of tasks is launched.  A *stage* is a group of tasks that all perform the same computation, but on different input data.  One task is launched for each partitition, as shown in the example below.  A task is a unit of execution that runs on a single machine. When we run `map(f)` within a partition, a new *task* applies `f` to all of the entries in a particular partition, and outputs a new partition. In this example figure, the dataset is broken into four partitions, so four `map()` tasks are launched.\n",

    "\n",
    "When applying the `map()` transformation, each item in the parent RDD will map to one element in the new RDD. So, if the parent RDD has twenty elements, the new RDD will also have twenty items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will use `map()` to subtract one from each value in the base RDD we just created. First, we define a Python function called `sub()` that will subtract one from the input integer. Second, we will pass each item in the base RDD into a `map()` transformation that applies the `sub()` function to each element. And finally, we print out the RDD transformation hierarchy using `toDebugString()`."

The key advantage of using `takeOrdered()` instead of `first()` or `take()` is that `takeOrdered()` returns a deterministic result, while the other two actions may return differing results, depending on the number of partions or execution environment. `takeOrdered()` returns the list sorted in *ascending order*.  The `top()` action is similar to `takeOrdered()` except that it returns the list in *descending order.*\n",

The function should be commutative and associative, as `reduce()` is applied at the partition level and then again to aggregate results from partitions.  If these rules don't hold, the results from `reduce()` will be inconsistent.  Reducing locally at partitions makes `reduce()` very efficient."
